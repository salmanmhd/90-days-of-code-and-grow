# Journal - 90 days of code and grow

This is journal that I will maintain, where I will write about my day and there will be section every day about two things

1. What went well
2. What went wrong
3. What can be improved

## Day 4:

Overall the day was not good. I woke up late and not feel active all the day. Most of the time I was laying on the bed and consuming the content.

### What can be improved

- Reducing content consumption
- Waking up early and start gym
- Focused study

### Tomorrow's Plan

- [ ] Objects and Prototypes
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Solve multiple questions

<!-- ## Day _
