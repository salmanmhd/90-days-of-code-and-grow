# Journal - 90 days of code and grow

This is journal that I will maintain, where I will write about my day and there will be section every day about two things

1. What went well
2. What went wrong
3. What can be improved

## Day 4:

Overall the day was not good. I woke up late and not feel active all the day. Most of the time I was laying on the bed and consuming the content.

### What can be improved

- Reducing content consumption
- Waking up early and start gym
- Focused study

### Tomorrow's Plan

- Objects and Prototypes
- Classes
- Solve multiple questions

## Day 5

The day was overall good, just bad start and bad ending. The mid was good, I completed some pending tasks, went to gym, prepare food for myself. Even studied for 4-5 hours. But after 6 pm I was not able to study properly.
The worst is every time I have to deal with regrets, self doubts, and overthinking. This is the main reason to feel less confident and doubting own ability.

### Today's task:

- [x] Objects
- ❌ Prototypes
- ❌ Classes
- ❌ Solve multiple questions

### What went wrong

- Not manage the time properly after 6pm, I have to say NO to distractions.
- Thinking more and doing less

### What can be improved

- saying NO to distractions
- manage time properly

<!-- ## Day _
### What went well
### What went wrong
### What can be improved -->
