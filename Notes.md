## Day 1:

Why tags are important and use different tags when we can do all the things just by using 2 tags div and p.

- Its important to use different tags to improve SEO, for example when we use h1, it show that text is important or considered as topics, h2 for sub topics.
- Another example is for footer, below example demonstrate a better way to write good footer.

  ```html
  <footer>
    <p>near xyz, XYZ city - 12345</p>
  </footer>

  <!-- better way to write -->
  <footer>
    <address>near xyz, XYZ city - 12345</address>
  </footer>
  ```
