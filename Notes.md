## HTML

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://google.com">Link to a new page</a>
  </body>
</html>

```

Why tags are important and use different tags when we can do all the things just by using 2 tags div and p.

- Its important to use different tags to improve SEO, for example when we use h1, it show that text is important or considered as topics, h2 for sub topics.
- Another example is for footer, below example demonstrate a better way to write good footer.

  ```html
  <footer>
    <p>near xyz, XYZ city - 12345</p>
  </footer>

  <!-- better way to write -->
  <footer>
    <address>near xyz, XYZ city - 12345</address>
  </footer>
  ```

#### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags that describe the purpose of content. Common semantic elements include:

```html
<header>
  : Defines a header section.
  <nav>
    : Defines a navigation section.
    <main>
      : Represents the main content.
      <footer>
        : Represents a footer section.
        <article>
          : Represents a standalone piece of content.
          <section>
            : Groups related content together. ### CSS ### Extras
          </section>
        </article>
      </footer>
    </main>
  </nav>
</header>
```

## CSS

### Flexbox Essentials

- **Main Axis**: Horizontal (by default).
- **Cross Axis**: Vertical (by default).

#### Alignment Properties

- **Justify-content**: Aligns items along the main axis.
- **Align-items**: Aligns items along the cross axis.
  - Common values: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`.

##### Other Flexbox Properties

- **Align-content**: Aligns multi-line flex containers along the cross axis.
- **Gap, Row-gap, Column-gap**: Defines space between items.

##### Flex-Wrap & Responsiveness

- **Flex-wrap**: Wraps items to the next line when space is reduced, keeping item widths intact (responsive break).

##### Flex-Grow & Flex-Shrink

- **Flex-grow**: Expands items to fill available space.
  - Works well with `min-width` and `max-width` for responsive scaling.
- **Flex-shrink**: Shrinks items when space is tight.

##### Miscellaneous

- **Align-self**: Aligns a single item independently of others.
- **`margin-right: auto;`**: Pushes the element to the far left, using available space.

### Grid

- `grid-template-columns` & `grid-template-rows`

  - Defines the number and size of columns/rows.
  - Example: `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);`

- `grid-column-gap` / `grid-row-gap` / `gap`

  - Defines space between columns/rows. Use `gap` for shorthand.
  - Example: `gap: 20px;`

- `grid-template-areas`
  - Defines a grid template using named areas.
  - Example:
    ```css
    grid-template-areas:
      'header header header'
      'sidebar main main'
      'footer footer footer';
    ```

#### Item Properties

- `grid-column` / `grid-row`

  - Specifies how many columns/rows a grid item should span.
  - Example: `grid-column: 1 / 3;`

- `grid-area`

  - Places an item in a named grid area.
  - Example: `grid-area: header;`

- `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));` This will auto maintain the number of columns as per the width.
- `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 250px)`

# Javascript

## Primitive Types

## Stack and heap memory

- `Stack memory` - variable get copy of value
- `Heap memory` - variable get reference as copy

- Value Types and Reference Types

  - Primitive are copied by their value
  - Objects are copied by their reference
  - So when we pass the primitive in functions their value will not be changed, as it will be copied by their value but for object it will be copied by reference.

  ```Javascript
  let a = 12;
  function abc(number) {
  number++;
  }

  abc(a);
  console.log(a); // 12

  const obj = [12, 3, 4];

  function array(arr) {
  arr.push(123);
  }
  array(obj);
  console.log(obj); // [12, 3, 4, 123]

  ```

## `Execution Context` (Call Stack, Execution context stack, program stack, control stack, runtime stack, machine stack)

Execution context is a concept that represents the environment in which Js code is executed

1. Memory creation
   - first it will assign the memory to all variable as undefined and for function it stores all the code as it is
2. Code execution
   - In the code execution it will actually run the code and if there is any function call then it will create another execution context for function which is called as `function execution context` which will again have the same thing as global execution context. FEC will be deleted after the function call

### Memory Creation

1. Javascript stores the variables as undefined and for function

- `==` with this we just check the value, Js auto type conversion can change the output as well. Like 2 == "2" -> true
- `Type coersion` can be done while checking two variables (==, >, <,)
  - implicit coersion - auto coversion. It happens when we are `comparing two numbers` or when we are `adding two variable one is number and other is string`, then the resultant will be the sum of those two numbers in String, `truthy or falsy values converting to 1 or 0`
  - explicit coersion - manual converison with the built in methods
- `===` with this we check both the value and type
- `Falsy Values` - false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN, -0

## Expression vs. Statement

`Expression`: A piece of code that evaluates to a value (e.g., 2 + 2, "Hello", Math.max(10, 20)).
`Statement`: A piece of code that performs an action (e.g., if, for, function, let x = 5;).

## Hoisting

- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope.

### Key Points

1. **Variable Hoisting**

   - `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`
   - `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone)

2. **Function Hoisting**

   - Function declarations are fully hoisted
   - Function expressions are not hoisted (`const sum = a, b => a+b`)

3. **Order of Precedence**
   - Function declarations are hoisted before variable declarations

## Examples

### Variable Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError
let y = 10;
```

## Lexical Scoping

## Closures

**`Closure`** is function along with its lexical environment.

### Key Points

- **Encapsulation**: Closures allow private variables in JavaScript by wrapping data inside functions.
- **Persistent State**: Variables in closures persist, even when the outer function has returned.
- **Scope Chain**: The inner function maintains a reference to the variables in the outer scope.

### Uses

- Modules Design Pattern
- Currying
- functions like once
- memoize
- maintaining state in async world
- setTimeouts
- Iterators
- and many more

## Functions

```javascript
function sum(num1, num2, ...num3) {
  // num3 will have all the remaining values in the form of array - [3,4,5,6,7,8]
}

sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
```

- `this` give the current context, when used inside the functions it will all the values, etc

## Arrow functions

- When using {}, return keyword is required
- () - no return required
-

### When not to use Arrow functions:

1. Object methods
2. prototypes
3. Constructors
4. Event handlers

## IIFE

An **IIFE** is a function that is **executed immediately** after being defined. It creates a new scope to avoid polluting the global scope.

### Syntax

```javascript
(function () {
  // Code inside IIFE
})();
```

### Use Cases

1. **Avoid Global Variable Pollution**  
   Prevents variables from leaking into the global scope by encapsulating them in a local scope.

2. **Encapsulation of Code**  
   Keeps variables and functions private, avoiding naming conflicts and ensuring that the code remains isolated.

3. **Safe Initialization**  
   Executes initialization code that only needs to run once, such as configuration settings or setting up state.

4. **Modular Code**  
   Allows for the creation of self-contained modules of code that do not interfere with other parts of the application.

5. **Event-Driven Code**  
   Used to create isolated environments for event listeners, preventing variables from affecting other event handlers.

6. **Avoid Variable Hoisting Issues**  
   Since IIFEs are executed immediately, they help avoid issues with variable hoisting, ensuring variables are not misused before they are defined.

## Callback functions

## Higher Order Functions

**Higher-Order Function** is a function that either:

1. Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
2. Returns a function as its result.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Callbacks**: Passing a function as an argument to another function, e.g., in event handling or asynchronous programming.
2. **Function Composition**: Creating new functions by combining other functions.
3. **Array Methods**: Methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` are examples of higher-order functions.

## Pure Functoions

1. Always `returns the same output`, for a given input. Not dependent on the external variables to return the output.
2. `No side-effects` -

### Example of a Pure Function:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In this example:

- **Deterministic**: For inputs `2` and `3`, the output will always be `5`.
- **No Side Effects**: The function only computes and returns a value without altering any external state.

**Note**: _If a pure function calls a pure function this isnâ€™t a side effect and the calling function is still pure._

## Side Effects

A **side effect** occurs when a function interacts with external states or has observable effects outside of returning a value. Common examples of side effects include:

- Modifying variables or objects outside the function scope.
- Writing or reading from external resources (e.g., databases, files).
- Manipulating the DOM or console logging.
- Triggering network requests.

### Example of a Function with Side Effects:

```javascript
let count = 0;

function increment() {
  count += 1;
  return count;
}
```

In this example:

- **Non-deterministic**: The result depends on how many times `increment()` is called.
- **Side Effect**: The global variable `count` is being modified.

## Impure functions

- DOM manipulation
- Math.random()
- new Date()
- User input
- File IO
- Network Request
-

## Mutation

**State mutation** occurs when the state (e.g., variables, objects, or arrays) in a program is directly modified or altered. In JavaScript, this can happen when you change the values of objects or arrays in place rather than creating a new version of that data.

### Example of State Mutation:

```javascript
let state = { count: 0 };

function incrementCount() {
  state.count += 1; // Mutating the state
}

incrementCount();
console.log(state.count); // Output: 1
```

In this example, the `state` object is directly modified within the `incrementCount()` function.

## Problems with State Mutation

State mutation can lead to several issues, including:

- **Unpredictability**: The state can be modified by different parts of your code, potentially leading to unpredictable outcomes.
- **Complex Testing**: Functions that mutate state are more difficult to test as they change external data.
- **Concurrency Issues**: When dealing with asynchronous programming, state mutation can cause race conditions and inconsistent states.

### Example of Asynchronous Mutation Issues:

```javascript
let state = { count: 0 };

function asyncIncrement() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    state.count += 1; // Mutating state asynchronously
    console.log(state.count);
  }, 1000);
}

asyncIncrement();
asyncIncrement();
```

Here, depending on the timing, `state.count` might not behave as expected, leading to potential concurrency issues.

### Avoiding State Mutation

#### Immutability

One way to avoid mutation is by working with **immutable data structures**, where instead of changing the existing data, `you create and return a new version of the data with the necessary changes`.

### Example of Avoiding Mutation:

```javascript
let state = { count: 0 };

function incrementCount(state) {
  return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 }; // Returning a new state object
}

let newState = incrementCount(state);
console.log(newState.count); // Output: 1
console.log(state.count); // Output: 0 (Original state remains unchanged)
```

In this case, we avoid mutation by using the spread operator to create a new object with updated values, rather than changing the existing object.

## Array

## Array Handbook

This handbook explores various methods for manipulating arrays in JavaScript.

**Covered Methods:**

- `push()`: Adds an element to the end of the array.
- `pop()`: Removes the last element from the array.
- `shift()`: Removes the first element from the array.
- `unshift()`: Adds an element to the beginning of the array.
- `concat()`: Creates a new array by merging existing arrays.
- `forEach()`: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
- `map()`: Creates a new array with elements transformed by a provided function.
- `filter()`: Creates a new array with elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function.
- `find()`: Returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies a provided testing function.
- `sort()`: Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.

## Objects

- `Singleton` - when objects are made with constructor then it's singleton objects like `Object.create`
- `Object literals` - `const obj = {}`

### Accessing Objects:

1. `dot notaion` - we can access the values of objects using dot notaion like `student.name`
2. square brackets - this can be also used to access the objects. Even this can be more useful sometime when the key is used like `"full name": "your full name"`. Then the only option by which we can access the objects is `student["full name"]`

### Object freeze

- `Object.freeze(student)` - it is used to stop any changes further. If anyone's trying to change the values of that object then it will not change and also no error will be thrown

### Using symbol in Object

```javascript
const studetn = {
  name: 'Random Name',
  [symbol]: 'symbol Name',
};
```

- Accessing symbol: `student[symbol]`

### Combining two objects

```Javascript
  const copiedObjects = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
```

- the first object is the target object and rest are source. Using a blank object in the target will be useful in avoiding mutation.

```Javascript
  const copiedObjects = {...obj1, ...obj2};
```

- This is more easy way to combine objects

### Object.create

Create new object with the existing object

### Getting key and values

```javascript
const keys = Object.keys(obj1);
const values = Object.values(obj1);
const keyValuePairInArray = Object.entries(obj1);
```

## Looping over Objects:

```Javascript
  // iterating over keys or values
  for(const keys of Object.keys(obj)){
    console.log(keys); // printing keys - for values just Object.values(obj)
  }

  // Iterating through the Object
const openHours = {
  Sun: { open: 12, close: 23 },
  Mon: { open: 9, close: 23 },
  Tue: { open: 9, close: 23 },
  Wed: { open: 9, close: 23 },
};

const entries = Object.entries(openHours);

for (const [day, { open, close }] of entries) {
  console.log(`On ${day}, we open at ${open} and close at ${close}`);
}
```

## Object Destructure

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
};

const { firstName: name, lastName, age } = person;
```

### Call method

- This method is used to borrow functions for objects. Means we can use the functions outside objects or from other objects with `this` keyword.
- `Method 1:` using functions of other objects

```javascript
const person = {
  fullName: function (city, country) {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} from  ${city}, ${country} `;
  },
};

const person1 = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
};

console.log(person.fullName.call(person1, 'New York', 'USA'));
```

- `Method 2:` using normal functions

```javascript
const person1 = {
  firstName: 'Samm',
  lastName: 'Rei',
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
};

function fullName(city, country) {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} from  ${city}, ${country}`;
}

console.log(fullName.call(person1, 'New York', 'USA'));
console.log(fullName.call(person2, 'New York', 'USA'));
```

### Apply method

This is similar to call method, the only difference is how we are passing the arguments. we pass the arguments as array.

```javascript
console.log(fullName.apply(person1, ['New York', 'USA']));
// we don't have to use array methods to use that elements
```

### Bind method

Bind method returns a function which we can say is attached to the object that we pass and later on we have to invoke that function

- The bind() method of Function instances creates a new function that, when called, calls this function with its this keyword set to the provided value

```javascript
const details = fullName.bind(person2, 'New York', 'USA');

// now details is a new function bind to only person2, since this is a new function so when we have to use it we have invoke it
// details();
```

### Prototype Inheritance and Prototype Chain

Js attaches properties to the objects.

## Destructuring

### Object destructuring:

- The name should match with the properties of objects
- we can rename them by `objectProperties: newName`

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Salman',
  address: 'New Delhi',
  hometown: 'Patna',
};

const { name, hometown } = obj;
// const { name: personName, hometown: city } = obj;
```

### Array destructuring:

- In array destructuring the index position in important

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Destructuring the array
const [first, second, third] = arr;
```

## Rest Operator

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];

// Destructuring the array
const [first, second, third, ...rest] = arr;
```

## Spread Operator

### Array

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
const nums2 = [...nums, 9, 10, 11];
```

### Objects

Creating a copy of objects and adding properties

```javascript
const obj1 = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1, hometown: 'New York', profession: 'Engineer', age: 24 };
// age will be updated to 24
```

## Reduce Method

```javascript
const totalPages = book.reduce((acc, book) => acc + book.pages, 0);
```

## Array Sorting

```javascript
const newArr = [5, 3, 7, 2, 31, 98, 90];

console.log(newArr.sort()); // this is used to sort array consists of string values, for numbers it will give wrong output as it compares the digit not the value digit

console.log(newArr.sort((a, b) => a - b));
console.log(newArr.sort((a, b) => b - a));
```

## Updating array or objects

```javascript
const updatedBooks = books.map((book) =>
  book.id === 1 ? { ...book, page: 210 } : book
);
```

## Strings

we can access the letters just like array `'str'[0]`

```Javascript
  const warning = "don't open that!";
  console.log(warning.indexOf('t'))
  console.log(warning.indexOf('open'))
  console.log(warning.lastIndexOf('open'))

  // SLICE - gives a part of string
  console.log(warning.slice(4)) // start from 4th index
  console.log(warning.slice(4, 9)) // start from 4, end at 8
  console.log(warning.slice(-1)) // start from the end


console.log(str1.trim()); // this will remove whitespaces
console.log(str1.toLowerCase())


const para = 'there are so many flowers in the garden, flowers look amazing';
console.log(a.replaceAll('flowers', 'fruits')); // replace will work only on first occurence, replace do the work as name suggest

.include("")
.startsWith("")
.endsWith("")

.split(" ") // the string will be converted to an array as space separation

.join("-") // will join the arrays separated by -
str.pasStart(25, "-"); // it will make the str length 25, fill the start with "-" in the begining of str

function maskCardNumber(cardNumber) {
  const n = cardNumber + '';
  const lastFourdigits = n.slice(-4);
  return lastFourdigits.padStart(n.length, '*');
}




```

## Sets

Set is another form of array we can say but there are majorly two differences:

1. It stores only unique values
2. It is not like index based, but LIFO just like linked list

```javascript
const newSet = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); // iterator is required to ceate new Set
newSet.add(5); // add element at the end
newSet.delete(4); // delete any element
newSet.has(5); // chech if it has?
newSet.size;
// newSet.clear();

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 34, 54, 5];

const newArray = [...new Set(arr1)]; // removing duplicates from an array
```

## Maps

### Methods of Map:

- `set(key, value)`: Adds or updates the value for the given key.
- `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the key.
- `has(key)`: Checks whether the key exists in the map.
- `delete(key)`: Removes the key-value pair.
- `clear()`: Removes all key-value pairs.
- `size`: Returns the number of key-value pairs.
<!-- --------------------- -->

### Introduction

The `Map` object in JavaScript holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

## Key Features

- **Unique Keys**: Each key in a `Map` is unique.
- **Insertion Order**: Iteration happens in the order of entry insertion.
- **Any Data Type**: Keys and values can be of any data type.

## Basic Usage

### Creating a Map

```javascript
let map = new Map();
```

### Adding Entries

```javascript
map.set('key1', 'value1');
map.set('key2', 'value2');
```

### Accessing Values

```javascript
let value = map.get('key1'); // 'value1'
```

### Checking for Keys

```javascript
let hasKey = map.has('key1'); // true
```

### Removing Entries

```javascript
map.delete('key1');
```

### Iterating Over a Map

```javascript
for (let [key, value] of map) {
  console.log(key, value);
}
```

### Size of the Map

```javascript
let size = map.size; // 1
```

### Clearing the Map

```javascript
map.clear();
```

## Comparison with Objects

- **Accidental Keys**: `Map` does not contain any keys by default, whereas `Object` has a prototype with default keys.
- **Key Types**: `Map` keys can be any value, while `Object` keys must be strings or symbols.
- **Order**: `Map` maintains the order of entries, while `Object` does not guarantee order.

## Example

```javascript
let map = new Map([
  ['name', 'John'],
  ['age', 30],
]);

console.log(map.get('name')); // John
console.log(map.size); // 2
```

<!-- ----------------  FORKIFY APP  --------------- -->

- `User story` - description of the app's functionality from the user's perspective

<!-- ------------------------------- -->

## Classes:

- `static method`: it can be used to store the methods that is not related to objects of that class but to that class only. **Can only be called by the class itself not by the objects of that class**

```javascript
 class Student{
  constructor(name, id, class){
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
    this.class = class;
  }

  static details(){
    console.log("I am the class to store student details")
  }

  studentDetails(){
    console.log(`${this.name} is a student of class ${this.class} and the roll no is ${this.id}`)
  }

 }
```

## Date Methods in JavaScript

- **Creating a Date Object:** `new Date()`
- **Getting Date Components:**
  - `getDate()`
  - `getMonth()`
  - `getFullYear()`
  - `getHours()`
  - `getMinutes()`
  - `getSeconds()`
- **Setting Date Components:**
  - `setFullYear(year)`
  - `setMonth(month)`
- **Time in Milliseconds:** `getTime()`
- **Creating a New Date:** `new Date(year, month, day)`

## JSON

- `JSON.parse` - parse data from JSON
- `JSON.stringify` - convert object into string

## Maths

## Math Methods in JavaScript

- **Rounding:**
  - `round()`
  - `ceil()`: 2.3 -> 3
  - `floor()`: 2.3 -> 2
- **Random Numbers:** `random()`
- **Maximum and Minimum:**
  - `max()`
  - `min()`
- **Exponentiation and Square Root:**
  - `pow()`
  - `sqrt()`

## Async in JavaScript

### Key Async Functions:

- **`setTimeout()`**:
  - Schedules a function to execute after a set time.
  - Example: `setTimeout(() => console.log("Hello!"), 1000);`
- **`fs.readFile()`** (Node.js):

  - Asynchronously reads a file from the filesystem.
  - Example:
    ```js
    const fs = require('fs');
    fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(data);
    });
    ```

- **`fetch()`**:
  - Makes asynchronous network requests, typically to get data from a server.
  - Example:
    ```js
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => console.log(data));
    ```

---

### Async Architecture:

- **Call Stack**:

  - Manages the execution of synchronous code. Functions are pushed and popped in a LIFO order.

- **Web APIs**:

  - External environments like timers, HTTP requests, etc., that handle async operations outside the call stack.

- **Callback Queue**:

  - Holds asynchronous callbacks waiting for execution. These are processed by the event loop after the call stack is empty.

- **Event Loop**:
  - Monitors the call stack and callback queue. It moves tasks from the queue to the stack when the stack is empty, ensuring async callbacks are executed.

### The async process:

1. the code will start with the call stack and run normally until any async code is there
2. When there is any async code, it will push to the web apis. Now the call stack will execute further, besides this the web apis is running side by side.
3. when web apis completed a task, it will move the callback queue. That async task will reach which is completed, no matter which starts first
4. when the stack is empty, then event loop will move the tasks from queue to stack.

## Promises

```javascript
function asyncFunc() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve('Hi there');
  });
}

const data = asyncFunc().then(() => console.log(data));
```

# Node JS

Node is a runtime

ecmascript, javascript, node, bun

## HTTP Server:

1. A protocol that is defined for machines to communicate
2. Specifically for websites, it is the most common way for your website's frontend to talk to its backend

# Environment Variables
