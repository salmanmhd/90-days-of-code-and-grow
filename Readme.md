# 💻 90 Days Coding Challenge: Journey to Becoming a Confident Full-Stack Developer

Welcome to my **90 Days Code & Grow Challenge**, where I'm committed to becoming a confident full-stack developer by building solid projects, mastering key concepts, and creating consistent, valuable content.

## 🌟 Overview

This challenge is all about honing my skills as a developer with a strong focus on consistency, daily progress, and building confidence. I began my coding journey in July 2022 and quickly developed a passion for it. However, the biggest hurdle I’ve faced is a lack of consistency, which has often forced me to restart from scratch and diminished my confidence.

Despite learning a lot and working on a few projects, the stop-and-start cycle held me back from achieving my full potential. Now, the goal is clear: stay consistent, push through obstacles, and become the confident developer I've always wanted to be.

Throughout this challenge, I’ll be documenting my journey on YouTube, sharing key learnings, and regularly pushing code to GitHub to track my progress. This is about growing not just as a coder, but as a creator committed to delivering value and improving every day.

## 📌 Daily Commitments
